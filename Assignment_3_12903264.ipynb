        "Mining any information from social data presents some unique challenges compared to other data mining problems and sources\n",
        "1.\tWith Social Media, privacy can be easily compromised if data is not secured. For any manner of analysis to be successful, intelligence must be derived by knowing exactly what a customer was trying to achieve. If someone is praising or complaining, the truth behind the comment is not known unless data mining processes know exactly what the customer was doing. This means knowing what the customer did, what data they provided, what action/output they expected, and all this could constitute violation of privacy. Models evolve over time and Patterns take time to emerge over time and private data of customers is sometimes stored for long periods of time. Finally, as was postulated for a national election, few years ago, social media can be manipulated to place information that could influence a poll in a certain way\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tBias created by vocal customers. Generally vocal customers alone tend to share information on social media. Indexing responses to such customers could lead to unnecessary focus on a small segment of users. In addition, certain age groups tend to be more expressive on social media and are often not the most important customers (often younger people share feedback faster but are often not the decision maker in buy decisions). Finally, people generally tend to share negative opinions more easily than positive opinions, so it is important to use the feedback carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\tHow to measure performance of the analysis. Understanding social media is still a fledgling science. While models generally predict well, interpretation for specific situations need special skills. Understanding how to use this for a political situation, is different from how to do product placement to increase buy decisions, which is different from how to tempt people to donate. Each situation plays out in social media but the way to understand the true opinion and how to sway it ethically is still a challenge \n"
